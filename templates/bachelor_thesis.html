              <p>PV Systems on Refrigerated Warehouses</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><strong>Abstract</strong>
            <p></p>
            Despite recent years of rapid development, PV power constitutes for only 0.4 % of the total installed
            capacity of power production in Norway, making this an area with huge potential for expansion. Finding
            suitable areas for instalment is crucial for utilizing this potential. Refrigerated warehouses are a
            special case that fit in this category, as their consumption increases during summer months with higher
            ambient
            temperatures, coinciding with increased potential for production from solar power. This thesis will
            investigate this suggested correlation for five different locations in Norway over a period of 25 years,
            in addition to uncovering differences in these locations related to production and finance over the same
            period. The selected locations represent major cities in Norway from each of the five different bidding
            zones and are, from South to North, Kristiansand, Oslo, Bergen, Trondheim and Tromsø.
            <p></p>
            The background section of the reports is divided into three main chapters, covering the basis for
            answering
            the thesis. This includes a review of PV technology, covering PV history, PV fundamentals and influencing
            factors on the performance of PV panels. In addition, the meteorological conditions of Norway are
            explored, extracting relevant information and statistics on elements such as irradiance, temperature and
            precipitation. The final chapter covers the electricity market, providing information on how power is
            bought and sold, in addition to both current and historical price differences across regions for selected
            cities.
            <p></p>
            In order to answer our selected thesis, a load profile was needed, together with production values from PV
            systems in selected locations. A load profile was gathered by asking several relevant companies for data,
            and through a selection process, the load profile from ASKO Midt-Norge in Trondheim was selected. For
            producing production results, the computer software program PVsyst was used by designing a system
            and simulating production results in each city. The designed PV system has a capacity of 1181 kW p,
            covering 6000 m2
            . The Pearson correlation between the selected load profile and PV productions was
            calculated using Python to examine the fit between refrigerated warehouses and PV system using a
            statistical measurement.
            <p></p>
            The financial analysis is also performed in Python by gathering grid tariffs and historical electricity
            price
            data for the different regions and importing the production values from PVsyst. Several considerations
            regarding the implementation of electricity prices, installation costs and maintenance cost have been made
            to produce a cash flow analysis. Financial results parameters are provided in the form of net present
            value (NPV) based on yearly cash flows and a discount rate of 4%, in addition to calculating the internal
            rate of return (IRR). The amount of overproduction was discovered and curtailed if it exceeded a certain
            amount.
            <p></p>
            Based on the analysis, it is found that there is a moderate correlation of 0.3552-0.4209 between simulated
            PV production and load at the refrigerated warehouse. PV production is highest in Kristiansand at 920
            MW h/year, and decreases northwards to Tromsø at 575 MW h/year. This is due to higher irradiance
            south in Norway. Bergen is the exception and has the second-lowest production due to cloud coverage,
            despite being south of Trondheim.
            At refrigerated warehouses, PV systems are a suitable measure to reduce energy demand and costs as a
            result of seasonal and intradaily similarities in production and load. PV systems can contribute to peak
            shaving at refrigerated warehouses, but the financial benefit of this is lost mainly due to curtailing.
            The
            load-production correlation would be better utilized without curtailing and the cost reductions would see
            a 20.8 - 45.2 % increase, depending on the city.
            <p></p>
            From an overall perspective, considering both regional PV production and financial differences,
            Kristiansand is the most suited for utilizing PV systems on refrigerated warehouses. Oslo and
            Trondheim share second place, not so far behind Kristiansand. Bergen is significantly worse suited,
            while Tromsø is by far the worst with the lowest production and a poorly suited electricity bill
            structure.

            <p><strong>My contributions</strong>
              Had the main responsibility of the financial analysis in Python. Imported data from collaberotors,
              Nordpool
              and simulation results to Python.
              Cleaned the data, including fixing missing data and handling leap years. Calculated the financial results
              based on the input data using packages and self created functions.
              Presented the results in the thesis using plots created using Matplotlib. Had also the
              co-responsibility
              of writing the chapters "Methodology" and "Discussion".
